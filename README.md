# Gameplay
In Space Invaders, you control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to shoot down waves of invading alien spaceships before they reach the bottom. The aliens move horizontally and gradually descend as they approach, increasing the difficulty. Your spaceship can move horizontally and shoot missiles to destroy the aliens. The game ends when an alien reaches the bottom or when you successfully eliminate all the aliens.

# Requirements
To run the Space Invaders game, you need to have a Scheme (BSL) interpreter installed on your system. One popular option is Racket, which provides a user-friendly environment for running Scheme programs. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed before proceeding.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open your preferred Scheme interpreter or IDE.
3. Load the space-invaders.rkt file into your interpreter.
4. Run the program to start the game.
5. Use the arrow keys to move your spaceship and the spacebar to shoot missiles.
6. Enjoy playing Space Invaders!
